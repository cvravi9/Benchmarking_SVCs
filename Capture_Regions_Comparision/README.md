# Capture Regions Comparision

In this comparision, the capture regions for the MIRACUM Main Workflow are changed to notice the differences in the vcf outcomes.

## 1. Inputs

* The first capture regions are from MIRACUM Annotated Data with the file name as *capture_targets_chr5_12_17.bed* and it could be downloaded from 

```
https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/h/miracum-annotation-data
```

* The second capture regions are from SOMATIC Truth Data and they are downloaded from

```
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/use_cases/mixtures/UMCUTRECHT_NA12878_NA24385_mixture_10052016/
```

* The workflow used to generate the vcf files are *Galaxy_Workflow_MIRACUM_main.ga* and the workflow has been downloaded from

```
https://github.com/AG-Boerries/MIRACUM-Pipe-Galaxy
```

* The inputs for the *Galaxy_Workflow_MIRACUM_main.ga* workflow are mapped normal and tumor samples generated through *Sub_Sampled_Data_Workflow.ga* workflow and *capture_targets_chr5_12_17.bed* captured regions.
