# SNPs and Positions
A single-nucleotide polymorphism is a substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome that is present in a sufficiently large fraction of the population. In this section, snps from different somatic variant callers are compared with the artifical truth data obtained from https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 

## Inputs
For the comparison, three vcf files from the Strelka somatic variant caller with the tumor purity of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 respectively are considered, three vcf files from the VarScan variant caller with the tumor purity of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 respectively are considered alongside the artificial truth data vcf file.
