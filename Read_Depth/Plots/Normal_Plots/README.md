# Read Depth - Normal Plots

In this section, Normal Read Depth based on positions are visualized using mathplotlib.

## 1. Inputs

* The four input csv files namely Final_Miracum_0.4.csv, Final_Miracum_0.7.csv, Final_Somatic_0.4.csv & Final_Somatic_0.7.csv.

* The files with 0.4.vcf are with Tumor Sample Purity of 0.4 and the ones with 0.7.vcf are with Tumor Sample Purity of 0.7.

## 2. Procedure

* The only step to plot is to execute 'Normal_DP_Plot.py' four times by changing the input file names.

* The output plot would have read depth values on the y-axis and positions on the x-axis.

## 3. Outputs

* The four output files are Miracum_0.4_Normal_Plot.pdf, Miracum_0.7_Normal_Plot.pdf, Somatic_0.4_Normal_Plot.pdf & Somatic_0.7_Normal_Plot.pdf
